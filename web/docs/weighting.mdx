# Weighting

Weights tell the generator to prefer certain parameter values over others. Weights are positive integers. When not explicitly specified, values have a weight of 1:

There is a special function `weight` that can be used to create a value with weight. It can be used with both the `pict` and `strings` API functions.

```js
import { pict, weight } from "pict-node";

const model = [
  {
    key: "type",
    values: [weight("Primary", 5), "Logical", "Single", "Span"],
  },
  {
    key: "formatMethod",
    values: ["quick", "slow"],
  },
  {
    key: "fileSystem",
    values: ["FAT", "FAT32", weight("NTFS", 10)],
  },
];

const cases = await pict({ model });
```
