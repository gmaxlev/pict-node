# Randomization

If a model and options given to the tool do not change, every run will result in the same output. However, the output can be randomized.

:::info
Read [PICT documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/pict/blob/main/doc/pict.md#output-format) to get more information about randomization.
:::

If the model does not change, running it repeatedly will result in the same output. To introduce randomness, you can use the `random` option.

It applies to `pict`, `strings` and `native` API.

```js
import { pict } from "pict-node";

const model = [
  // ...
];

const cases = await pict(
  { model },
  {
    random: true,
    // random: 19285 - or using with seed
  }
);
```
