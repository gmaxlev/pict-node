# Statistics

You can obtain model statistics using the `stats` method.

This method is accessible through the `pict`, `strings`, and `native` APIs.

```js
import { pict } from "pict-node";

const model = [
  {
    key: "platform",
    values: ["x86", "x64", "arm"],
  },
  {
    key: "ram",
    values: [1, 4, 64],
  },
];

const stats = await pict.stats({
  model,
});
```

The `stats` method returns an object with the following fields:

- `generationTimeNodeJs` - model generation time (including Node.js processing time)
- `generationTime` - model generation time (excluding Node.js processing time)
- `combinations` - number of combinations
- `generatedTests` - number of generated tests
