# Negative Testing

In addition to testing valid combinations, referred to as “positive testing,” it is often desirable to test using values outside the allowable range to make sure the program handles errors properly.

:::info
Read [PICT documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/pict/blob/main/doc/pict.md#negative-testing) to get more information about negative testing.
:::

There is a special function `negative` that can be used to create a value for negative testing. It can be used with both the `pict` and `strings` API functions.

```js
import { pict, negative } from "pict-node";

const model = [
  {
    key: "A",
    values: [negative(-1), 0, 1, 2],
  },
  {
    key: "B",
    values: [negative(-1), 0, 1, 2],
  },
];

const cases = await pict({ model });
```
