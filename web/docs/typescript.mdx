# TypeScript ðŸª„

The library provides excellent support for TypeScript.

Here is an example of using this tool with TypeScript:

```ts
import { pict, alias, weight } from "pict-node";

const model = [
  {
    key: "amount",
    //                           â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“
    values: [1, alias([2, "two"] as const), 3],
  },
  {
    key: "fruit",
    //                       â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“
    values: [weight("Banana" as const, 10), "Orange", "Apple"],
  },
  // â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“
] as const;

const cases = await pict({ model });
```

The type of `cases` will be:

```ts
Array<{
  amount: 1 | 2 | "two" | 3;
  fruit: "Banana" | "Orange" | "Apple";
}>;
```

:::warning
Note that we use `as const` to get a literal types!
